# Blink_Input

## Purpose
I created this code to be used as an Arduino tutorial for when I teach beginners. It is simple and does not require any additional hardware. This code was used with a Teensy 3.2 but can also be used on any Arduino compatible board.

## Description
This code checks for a numerical input from the serial terminal and then blinks the LED the specified number of times. This code accepts inputs up to four digits. I have not included checks for other types of inputs, so the behavior is unspecified.

## Tutorial
**Challenge 1:** Create a code to receive a single digit input from the terminal and blink the on-board LED the specified number of times.<br/>
**Challenge 2:** Modify the code to accept up to four digit inputs.
